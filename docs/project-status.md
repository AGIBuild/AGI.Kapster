# Project Status

## Current Status: Active Development

AGI.Kapster is in active development with a focus on cross-platform screen capture and overlay annotation functionality.

## Recent Major Changes

### Architecture Refactoring âœ… (Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress)
- **Service Layer Simplification**: Removed redundant `ScreenshotService`, consolidated service registrations
- **God Object Refactoring**: Split `OverlayWindow` from 1290 to 630 lines (51% reduction)
- **Handler Pattern Implementation**: Created specialized handlers for different responsibilities
- **State-Driven Architecture**: Implemented robust initialization and focus management
- **Enhanced Testing**: 256 unit tests with 100% pass rate
- **Platform Abstraction**: Improved cross-platform service implementations

### Build System Modernization âœ…
- **NUKE Integration**: Modern build automation with PowerShell scripts
- **GitHub Actions**: Comprehensive CI/CD with composite actions
- **Version Management**: Time-based locked versioning strategy
- **Multi-Platform Packaging**: Automated MSI, PKG, DEB, RPM creation

### Quality Improvements âœ…
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit test suite with mocking
- **File System Abstraction**: Testable service implementations
- **Code Organization**: Namespace alignment with physical structure
- **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation overhaul

## Technical Architecture

### Framework Stack
- **.NET 9.0** - Latest runtime with performance improvements
- **Avalonia UI 11** - Cross-platform desktop UI framework
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm** - MVVM pattern implementation
- **NUKE Build** - Modern build automation system

### Platform Support
| Platform | Status | Features |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Windows | âœ… Complete | Full UI Automation, MSI packaging |
| macOS | âœ… Functional | Basic capture, PKG packaging |
| Linux | ðŸš§ Planned | DEB/RPM packaging ready |

### Core Services
- **Screen Capture**: Multi-platform implementation with strategy pattern
- **Clipboard Operations**: Platform-specific clipboard handling
- **Overlay System**: Cross-screen overlay window management
- **Settings Management**: JSON-based configuration with file abstraction
- **Export System**: Image processing and file operations

## Development Workflow

### Current Branch Strategy
- `main` - Stable release branch
- `release` - Release preparation and hotfixes
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches

### Build Automation
- **Continuous Integration**: Build and test on every commit
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage thresholds and security scanning
- **Release Automation**: Tag-driven multi-platform releases
- **Package Distribution**: Automated GitHub Releases

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 95+ tests covering core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-platform service validation
- **UI Tests**: Overlay system and settings UI testing
- **Performance Tests**: Memory and resource usage validation

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Platform-Specific Issues
- **macOS**: Limited element detection capabilities
- **Linux**: Platform implementation not yet started
- **Windows**: UI Automation dependency for element detection

### Technical Debt
- Legacy code comments and documentation cleanup needed
- Some service interfaces could be further simplified
- Performance optimization opportunities in overlay rendering

## Upcoming Milestones

### Near-Term Goals
- [ ] Linux platform implementation
- [ ] Enhanced element detection for macOS
- [ ] Performance optimization for overlay rendering
- [ ] Advanced annotation features

### Long-Term Vision
- [ ] Plugin architecture for extensibility
- [ ] Cloud synchronization capabilities
- [ ] Advanced OCR integration
- [ ] Multi-monitor optimization

## Development Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage**: 85%+ (target: 90%+)
- **Build Success Rate**: 98%+ across all platforms
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% for public APIs
- **Security Scans**: No high/critical vulnerabilities

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Startup Time**: <2 seconds average
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB baseline
- **Capture Latency**: <100ms full-screen capture
- **Package Size**: <30MB cross-platform

## Contributing Guidelines

### Development Setup
1. Install .NET 9.0 SDK
2. Clone repository: `gh repo clone AGIBuild/AGI.Kapster`
3. Run initial build: `.\build.ps1`
4. Run tests: `.\build.ps1 Test`

### Code Standards
- Follow existing namespace conventions
- Maintain test coverage for new features
- Use dependency injection for service registration
- Document public APIs with XML comments

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run full build: `.\build.ps1 Clean Test`
4. Create pull request with clear description
5. Ensure CI passes before review
