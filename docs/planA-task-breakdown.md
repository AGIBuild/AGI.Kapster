# Project Planning Archive (Archived)

## Historical Task Breakdown (Plan A)

This document contains historical project planning information from the initial development phase using .NET 9 + Avalonia 11 + CommunityToolkit.Mvvm architecture.

> Archived: Historical planning only. See [Project Status](project-status.md) for current state.

## Completed Milestones

### M0 - Foundation & Framework ✅
- ✅ Cross-platform project scaffolding
- ✅ MVVM and dependency injection setup
- ✅ Platform interop foundation
- ✅ Basic logging and configuration

### M1 - Core Services ✅
- ✅ Screen capture service implementation
- ✅ Clipboard service with platform abstractions
- ✅ Hotkey registration system
- ✅ Settings management service

### M2 - Overlay System ✅
- ✅ Overlay window management
- ✅ Multi-screen support
- ✅ Platform-specific implementations
- ✅ Event-driven architecture

### M3 - UI Components ✅
- ✅ System tray integration
- ✅ Settings dialog
- ✅ Overlay rendering system
- ✅ Background-only operation

## Architecture Decisions Made

### Technology Stack
- **.NET 9.0**: Latest LTS version for performance and features
- **Avalonia UI 11**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm**: MVVM pattern implementation
- **NUKE Build**: Modern build automation

### Design Patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Platform Abstraction**: Service interfaces with platform-specific implementations
- **Event-Driven**: Loose coupling through event system
- **Background Service**: System tray only, no main window

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Removed Factory Pattern**: Simplified DI approach over factory abstractions
2. **Background-Only Mode**: Eliminated main window for cleaner UX
3. **Time-Based Versioning**: Predictable versioning strategy
4. **Composite Actions**: Reusable GitHub Actions components

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Cross-platform service abstraction
- NUKE build system integration
- GitHub Actions automation
- Test-driven development approach

### Challenges Overcome
- macOS black screen issue with overlay windows
- Clipboard access across platforms
- Version management complexity
- Build system optimization

### Future Considerations
- Enhanced element detection capabilities
- Advanced annotation features
- Performance optimizations
- Additional platform support
